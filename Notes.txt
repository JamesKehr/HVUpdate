-- Linux requirements --

1. The hostname must be resolvable from the HV host (i.e. Resolve-DnsName "<hostname>").
    - This may require mDNS to be manually installed on the VM.
    - Ubuntu/Debian-based: sudo apt update && sudo apt install libnss-mdns -y
2. SSH must be configured passwordless with a KeyFile.
    - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement
    - Logon to the Linux VM as the user that will be used for updates.
        - This user must be a sudoer (Linux administrator).
    - Run this command to generate key files for the user in the home directory:

    cd $HOME
    ssh-keygen -P "" -t rsa -b 4096 -m pem -f $(hostname)-kp

    - This command will create two files:
        <hostname>-kp
        <hostname>-kp.pub

    - Use this command to copy the public key to the authorized_keys file:

        cat "$(hostname)-kp.pub" >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

    - Copy the contents of <hostname>-kp to the Hyper-V host in a PEM file. You can copy/paste through SSH or use a command like this:

        scp user@server:/home/user/<hostname>-kp <Windows path>/<hostname>-kp.pem

        Example:

        scp user@gateway:/home/user/gateway-kp C:\Users\MyAdminAccount\AppData\Local\HVUpdate\gateway-kp.pem

    - Test SSH using the key file: 

        ssh -i <Windows path>/<hostname>-kp.pem <user>@<server>

        Example:

        ssh -i C:\Users\MyAdminAccount\AppData\Local\HVUpdate\gateway-kp.pem user@gateway

    - You should be be prompted for a password. That needs to change.
    - Edit the sudoer file:

        sudo nano /etc/sudoers

    - Go to the bottom of the file, past the "includedir /etc/sudoers.d" line, and add a line for your user account (replace username with your username):

        username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

    - Save and exit: Ctrl+X, y, Enter
    - Logoff of ssh by running: exit
    - SSH back in using the PEM file.
    - Run this command to confirm that passwordless commands are working.

        sudo apt update

    - Backup the -kp files to a safe place.

3. The KeyFile path and connection string must be added to the HVUpdateVault using: Add-HVUpdateCredential -KeyFile "<path to key file (.pem)>" -SSHPath '<user>@[server|IP|FQDN]'
4. Install PowerShell on the Linux VM.

5. Follow these steps to configure Linux sshd to use PowerShell remoting.

-- Windows requirements --

PSRemoting must be enabled. Server SKUs should have it enabled by default. Client SKUs may need it enabled manually.
